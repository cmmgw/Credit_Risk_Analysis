# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
Machine learning can be utilized to predict credit risk. By utilizing it, it will not only provide a quicker and more reliable loan experience but will also lead to a more accurate identification of good candidates for loans, which will lead to lower default rates. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, different techniques need to be employed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Numerous supervised machine learning models or algorithms have been built and evaluated to predict credit risk.
